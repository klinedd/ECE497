#readme file for Homework 06


The only file where I changed anything major to the code was etch-a-sketch.c

The file should already be made, so you can just run etch-a-sketch in sudo and
the code should work. For my etch-a-sketch code I made the trail bright white,
made the background a darker black, and made a big box for the 'pixel' of the
etch-a-sketch.

A sidenote, I could not get boris.png to display and it did not work to rename
it boris_education. Thus i just did the image rotation and labeling using
tux.png.

// Comments from Prof. Yoder
// I fixed boris.png, it should work now.
// It works!
