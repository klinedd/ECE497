List below instructs what I have done for each portion of hw01:

	1. I installed latest image on BeagleBone. However, as mentioned in 
	Tuesday's class, there is a new image that the professor will have us
	update to in the near future.

	2. Host computer has a functioning native version of ubuntu
	
	3. Attained kit from the parts room, bought two 8gig SD cards,
	and purchased a powered 4 x USB3.0 dongle.

	4. Git is working on computer and beaglebone. Finished the exercises
	getLearn and gitLearnFork

	5. I believe I successfully signed up for both groups. Awaiting a 
	digest in the form of an email to confirm

	6. etch-a-sketch program works and just needs to be documented at the 
	time of this writting
