There are two parts to this homework. The first part is getting the etch-a-sketch program running on the 8x8 LED grid.
The second part was wiring up the temperature sensors and getting them to display the temperature and also to trigger
an alert if the temperature went too low or too high.


For the Etch-a-sketch the command to run it is "python3 EtchASketchMkIII.py".
Then the program will ask you to choose whether you want to use the red LEDs or the green LEDS.
Then all you have to do is press the buttons to move your trail around.

The temperature sensor program can be ran with "python3 Temp.py".
This program is straight forward. Just rub your finger against the palm of your hand to get it warm and then 
touch it to the top of one of the sensors. You will then see the alert message pop up.
