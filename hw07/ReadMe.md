Within the hw07 folder there are four subfolders, one for the Python GPIO, (named Python_GPIO),
one for MMAP GPIO, (named MMAP), and one for the Kernel GPIO, (gpio_test), and then finally
a folder containing oscilloscope screenshots for each GPIO Speed testing program. Then there is 
the HW07_Resport.odt file which is the report required for this homework. Running the python file 
rquires nothing special. For MMAP, run the make file and then run the file generated from that.
For the Kernel module just insert the .ko file.
